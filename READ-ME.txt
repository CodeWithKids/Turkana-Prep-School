  # Turkana Preparatory School Website

This project is the official website for Turkana Preparatory School, customized from the KidKinder template.

## Setup

1.  **Add the Logo:** Place the school's logo file, named `logo.png`, into the `img/` folder.
2.  **View the Website:** Open any of the `.html` files (e.g., `index.html`) in a web browser to see the site.

## Customization

-   **Branding:** The school name and logo are set in the navigation bar of each `.html` file.
-   **Colors:** The theme colors (dark green `#2c5234` and light cream `#f5f5dc`) are defined in a `<style>` tag in the `<head>` of each HTML file. You can change them there.
-   **Content:** All text and images can be replaced by editing the HTML files and replacing files in the `img/` folder.
